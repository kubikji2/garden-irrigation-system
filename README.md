# Garden Irrigation System
All information and codes gathered regarding garden irrigation system goes here.


## Roadmap
Steps and decision required:

### 1. Do research about irrigation systems avialable and choose one

Most of the sources recommends using drip irridation system over watering by hand or using overhead irrigation or sprinklers.
Drip irridation usage saves water, eventhough precise number varies from 75-85% [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOpvLFwjS1g) to 30-60% [[2]](https://www.dripworks.com/media/wysiwyg/drip-planning-guide.pdf), delivers water near to the plant roots, minimize evaporation and runoffs [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/other/agricultural/types.html), prevents fungal diseas and decrease chance of overwatering as the water is delivered continously overtime[[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P86oiKTzuAo).
Additionaly, using drip irridation system can use both presurized [[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo2GFneYrfM) and non-presurized water source [[6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF5TeIQyiHY).
In case of presurized system, it is recommended to use loops without any deadends[[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo2GFneYrfM).
On the other hand, deadends possible for non-presurized variants as seen in [[6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF5TeIQyiHY).
Pressurized version has been controlled using arduino board and selenoid valve by Practical Engineering in [[7]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_Q1WKCtWiA).

### 2. Do research about valve types and its usage

Normally closed solenoid two-way valve seems to be way to go for first iteration as it remains closed until given current is applied.
For advanced node-based approach three-way normally closed solenoid valve is preffered.
Controlling a solenoid valve using arduino is described in [[14]](http://www.martyncurrey.com/controlling-a-solenoid-valve-from-an-arduino-updated/).

### 3. Do research about Arduino UNO and Arduiono NANO 

Recent version of Arduiono UNO uses two chips, one as the main processing unit, second as USB-to-serial converter.[[20]](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/24081/is-atmega328p-the-same-as-16u2)
Arduino UNO rev 3 is the most recent version of the basic Arduino USB board.
It is based on ATmega328P processiong unit, but compared to previous version (Duemilanove) uses different USB-to-serial chip known as ATMega8U2 [[21]](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/boards).
Arduiono duemilanove is since may 2009 based on same processing unit ATmega328P as its ancestor, no information about USB-to-serial chip found [[22]](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove).
Most of the "compatible" versions of Arduino UNO rev 3 uses CH340G chip instead of the ATMega8U2/ATM16U2.
As mentioned on quora [[23]](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Arduino-Uno-R3-compatible-board-ATmega328P-ATmega16U2-and-Arduino-Uno-R3-ATmega328P-USB-board-CH340G-Which-should-I-buy-and-why) it should not be a problem, as far as installing software from the chineese manufactuer site is ok for the user. Another anwers mentioned additional coplications using board with CH430G instead of ATM8U2/ATM16U2.
